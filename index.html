      Netflix, Inc. is an American subscription streaming service and production
      company. Launched on August 29, 1997, it offers a library of films and
      television series through distribution deals as well as its own
      productions, known as Netflix Originals. As of December 31, 2021, Netflix
      had over 221.8 million subscribers worldwide, including 75.2 million in
      the United States and Canada, 74.0 million in Europe, the Middle East and
      Africa, 39.9 million in Latin America and 32.7 million in
      Asia-Pacific.[11] It is available worldwide aside from Mainland China (due
      to local restrictions), Syria, North Korea, Russia and Crimea (due to US
      sanctions). Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film
      distribution, and is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).
